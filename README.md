# Data sets

We are working with the two soccer data sets below to create a broad picture between Fifa and English Premier League stats for 2020

-	https://www.kaggle.com/idoyo92/epl-stats-20192020?select=players_1920_fin.csv

# Data frame – The connecting piece, or join, between the two data sets.

# Database (Postgres or mongodb)

We have decided to utilize a Postgres database.

-   Schema – Load order
